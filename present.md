## 1. 🔁 Bubble Sort

**📌 Purpose:**  
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares and swaps adjacent values.  
It’s mainly used for **educational purposes** to explain sorting logic.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Very easy to understand and implement
- Great for learning how sorting works

**⚠️ Disadvantages:**
- Extremely inefficient for large datasets (Time complexity: O(n²))
- Rarely used in practice

---

## 2. 📦 Arrays (Lists)

**📌 Purpose:**  
Arrays (called **lists** in Python) are used to store multiple values in a single variable.  
They're **ordered**, **dynamic**, and support many operations.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Fast access to elements using index
- Easy to modify, append, and iterate
- Flexible in size compared to traditional arrays

**⚠️ Disadvantages:**
- Slower when inserting/deleting in the middle
- Not optimized for large-scale data manipulation

---

## 3. 🗺 Shortest Path (Dijkstra)

**📌 Purpose:**  
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the **shortest path** from one node to all others in a graph — useful in **navigation**, **networks**, and **optimization problems**.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Guarantees the shortest path for non-negative edge weights
- Efficient and widely used in real-world systems

**⚠️ Disadvantages:**
- Doesn’t support negative edge weights
- Can be memory-intensive on huge graphs

---

## 4. 🌳 AVL Trees

**📌 Purpose:**  
AVL Trees are a type of **self-balancing binary search tree** that maintains balance after insertions/deletions, ensuring fast access and consistent performance.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Guaranteed logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for search, insert, delete
- Always balanced → no performance degradation

**⚠️ Disadvantages:**
- More complex to implement than simple binary trees
- Rotations add additional overhead when modifying the tree

---

## 5. 🔑 Hash Sets (Python `set`)

**📌 Purpose:**  
Hash sets store **unique**, unordered elements. Ideal for checking **if an item exists**, filtering duplicates, or fast membership tests.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Extremely fast lookups, insertions, and removals (average O(1))
- Automatically removes duplicates

**⚠️ Disadvantages:**
- No order: items are not indexed
- Not suitable when element order matters
